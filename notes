#Rules for the portal renderer
To simulate nonconvex geometri, each par must by convex, making the illusion of making it a nonconvex geometry


#For drawing with projection

Known constants defined by developer
HFOV, YFOV

Vertex Positioning
All vertices of walls are transformed into first person view, meaning we are just actually being rotated relative to the players position:

Global position - v(x,y);
Transoform relative to player position - t(vx - px,vy -py);
Rotate them around the players view - 
	where
		transformX = tx * cos(angle) - ty * sin(angle)
		transformZ = tx * sin(angle) + ty * cos(angle)

Once this has been done, apply the perspective projection int 2d screen cords
        xScale = HFOV/transformZ; yScale = VFOV/transformZ;
	ScreenX = SCREEN_WIDTH/2 - (transformX * xScale);
	ScreenY = SCREEN_HEIGHT/2 - (offset * yScale) //Take account the offset of player height and yaw of floor wall 


IMPORTANT NOTE: AFTER DOING A TRANSFORM, ADJUST THE TRANSFORM RELATIVE POSITION,
 relative pos = pos + transformed;
#PORTAL SYSTEM - RULES TO FOLLOW
	SECTORS
		Section of the map with n Points to form walls, eac one with floors and ceiling
		Walls (SEGMENTS) are points that interconect each other
		the walls of a sector are defined in a clockwise direction
		Points considered as portals are the ones who has a neighbor sector
